# Meal-Planner
Meal Planner that generates recipes with ingredient and cooking details based on the user's daily calorie goals

Access the [demo here](https://andyl25.github.io/Meal-Planner/?calories=1000). Note that the demo uses a free Edamam API testing key so the search will be limited to 3 calls every minute.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The [Edamam API](https://developer.edamam.com/?gclid=CjwKCAjw4KyJBhAbEiwAaAQbE4G1fPayZssf7u8-DxpB6-gz906R7yOCTUc5INF0EGCD7w98ovOIRRoClogQAvD_BwE) was  used to curate recipes.
